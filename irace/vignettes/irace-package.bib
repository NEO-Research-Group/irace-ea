                  algorithm for computing the hypervolume indicator of
                  the quality of a set of $n$ non-dominated points in
                  $d>2$ dimensions. It improves upon the existing HSO
                  (Hypervolume by Slicing Objectives) algorithm by
                  pruning the recursion tree to avoid repeated
                  dominance checks and the recalculation of partial
                  hypervolumes. Additionally, it incorporates a recent
                  result for the three-dimensional special case.  The
                  proposed algorithm achieves $O(n^{d-2} \log n)$ time
                  and linear space complexity in the worst-case, but
                  experimental results show that the pruning
                  techniques used may reduce the time complexity
                  exponent even further.}

  title = {Analyzing Algorithms by Simulation: Variance Reduction
                  Techniques and Simulation Speedups},
  abstract = {Although experimental studies have been widely applied to the
                  investigation of algorithm performance, very little attention
                  has been given to experimental method in this area. This is
                  unfortunate, since much can be done to improve the quality of
                  the data obtained; often, much improvement may be needed for
                  the data to be useful. This paper gives a tutorial discussion
                  of two aspects of good experimental technique: the use of
                  variance reduction techniques and simulation speedups in
                  algorithm studies.  In an illustrative study, application of
                  variance reduction techniques produces a decrease in variance
                  by a factor 1000 in one case, giving a dramatic improvement
                  in the precision of experimental results. Furthermore, the
                  complexity of the simulation program is improved from
                  $\Theta(m n/H_n)$ to $\Theta(m + n \log n)$ (where $m$ is
                  typically much larger than $n$), giving a much faster
                  simulation program and therefore more data per unit of
                  computation time. The general application of variance
                  reduction techniques is also discussed for a variety of
                  algorithm problem domains.},
